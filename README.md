# FED - Practical Task 3

## ðŸ“„ Task Overview

This is my submission for the Front-End Development (FED) Practical Task 3.

I chose the **Development Only** approach â€” referring directly to the layout and sections provided in the PDF (`FED - Practical 3.pdf`). No design changes or creative redesign were applied. The project was built using **ReactJS** for component-based structure and **Bootstrap** for styling.

- Followed the structure and layout provided in the PDF.
- Used **ReactJS** (via Create React App) for a modular and scalable frontend.
- Implemented styling and layout using **Bootstrap 5**.
- Used dummy content where necessary, as allowed.
